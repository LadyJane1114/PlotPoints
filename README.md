<h2>Help Navigate to your next Book Crawl</h2>
<p>Over the summer, I enjoyed going on "book crawls", where I would go to various cafes or parks and read my book, thus getting out to enjoy a good walk and explore my city, as well as get some reading in. This app was made to help find places to go on such adventures!</p>

<h3>How It's Made</h3>
<p>This app was made in Android Studio using Kotlin, thus only runs on Android apps. It's only the beginning of what I'd like the app to be. This was made as a second year assignment for my NSCC Programming Mobile Application course, therefore the scope of the project was smaller than I would have liked. If I have time, I'd like to expand and add more features.</p>

<h3>Credits</h3>
This app primarily uses Mapbox functionality and features.

It also features the following icons:
